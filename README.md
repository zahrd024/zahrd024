# Welcome to my Empty Profile

Hello 🦊! I'm a simple internet person who lives within the Networking field 🌐.

💻 - I'm here on Github just to explore the amazing creations that are uploaded here that make life easier for me.

🚃 - My main Interests are Aviation and Trains (German ones to be specific) and I'll occassional talk about Technology like Windows, old Systems, etc.

💤 - Anyway that's all I really have to say since I'm not the chat type 😅
